I been known to miss a red flag
I been known to put my lover on a pedestal
In the end, those things just don't last
And it's time I take my rose-coloured glasses off
I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (mm)
Tryna make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (mm)
I already know your type, think you're playin' your cards right (mm)
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?
Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion
(Dance all night, dance all night)
(Dance all night, dance all night, I be like, ooh)
(Dance all night, dance all night)
(Dance all night, dance, dance)
デニーロ アル・パチーノ気取った悪ガキ
からエリート アサシン
平凡な Japanese
まで目の色変え hustlin'
手に入れたい Barbie (hey)
出来っこ無いマジック
いとも簡単に
敵やライバル煙に巻いた隙に
炎の中や水の中 空に高く浮かんだまま
獰猛なライオンの檻の中で気づいた君の策略に
I'm so bad bad bad bad bad
でも歌う hakuna matata
ニカっと笑ってスパッと真っ二つにされ
デビットカッパーフィールド (yeah)
Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion
(Dance all night, dance all night)
(Dance all night, dance all night, I be like, ooh)
(Dance all night, dance all night)
(Dance all night, dance, dance)
Illusion
I really like the way you're movin'
Yeah, I just wanna dance with the illusion
Yeah, I just wanna dance with
Yeah, I just wanna dance with
I could dance all night
時計が跨ぐ12時
滅びの呪文 believe me
のぞみも叶えぬ内に
ランプへと戻されるジーニー
箱に入っても無意味
どうせ皆ケンにもなれずに
この身預けた途端
するりすり抜ける君 フーディーニ
Ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin'
You think I'm gonna fall for an illu-
Ooh-ooh, what you doin'?
Don't know who you think that you're confusin'
I be like, ooh, it's amusin' (illusion, illusion, illusion, illusion)
You think I'm gonna fall for an illusion
